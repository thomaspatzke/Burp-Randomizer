<p>This extension registers a session handling rule which places a random value 
into a specified location within requests.</p>
<p>To use:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Load the extension into Burp.</li>
	<li>In the session handling options, create a rule which invokes the 
	Randomizer action that is registered by the extension, and select a suitable 
	scope for the rule.</li>
	<li>Place the string #RANDOM# into the relevant request at the location 
	where a random value is required.</li>
	<li>Let Burp operate on the request in the normal way (via Scanner, 
	Intruder, etc.).</li>
	<li>The extension will replace the string #RANDOM# with a random value in 
	each request.</li>
</ul>
